- 👋 Hi, I’m @John13busa
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Currently I am trying to learn C#(Sharp), it is my intention to improve my skill and knowledge about this language. I have been programming for awhile but have always used various versions of Basic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...to improve my skills in programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...Always interested in trying to help, while learning, I believe that in order to better understand a language it is easier to read what others have done and figure out why. It can give new insight into previous reasoning and sometimes it can be enlightening. I have always done my coding, as a multiple step process, continually refining my code to make it better. sometimes the best approach is to do it the hard way first and refine it from there.
My example for this is Mathmatics: the long way is not as elagant or speedy but it gets everything to where you want it, but once you know the end goal it can be refined to be faster.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
